- hi, I’m kabeer ahmed (wannabe polymath)
- 📽️ Host @ Kabeer2004 [https://www.youtube.com/Kabeer2004] & Codestreak [Codestreak](https://instagram.com/codestreak.dev)
- building cool stuff at [Existence](https://github.com/existence-master/), a startup I cofounded to solve problems and create a better tomorrow with AI
- i’m interested in ANYTHING you can label "nerdy"
- i’m decent at python, c++ and js - and use these in combination with databases, llms and more to build cool products. i love coding full-stack web, mobile and desktop applications. i also have an interest in hardware and have tinkered around a bit with arduino boards - this is actually where i started out with coding as a 12 year old.
- my other skills include Blender (i've made a couple renders), Unreal Engine (built a few basic games), Kali Linux (along with some experience using various cybersec tools - did TryHackMe and HackTheBox for a bit), video editing (premiere pro and after effects), along with music production (using tracktion waveform).
- i love Cyberpunk 2077 (definitely Game of the Year lol) or anything cyberpunk in general. i train in mixed martial arts and study japanese (currently pursuing jlpt n3). why japanese? idk japan is really cool and learning japanese seemed like a challenge (and proved itself to be one - but its a challenge i enjoy even today)
