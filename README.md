- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kabeer2004 (Certified Nerd)
- 📽️ Host @ Kabeer2004 [https://www.youtube.com/Kabeer2004]
- 👀 I’m interested in ANYTHING Python related (or even anything computer related).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I would consider myself a beginner - intermediate level Python programmer. My other skills include Unreal Engine, Kali Linux (along with experience with various cybersec tools) and video editing.
(I am learning Python because of its various applications in the field of machine learning and data science - a field that i am very interested in pursuing.)
- 💀 My hobbies include playing Cyberpunk 2077 (definitely Game of the Year lol) along with a recently growing obsession with gymming and the martial art Yongmoodo. i have also dabbled in music production and i am fluent with Premiere Pro which i use to edit videos for my YT channel. I am also currently studying Japanese (日本語) - i find the language and Japanese culture very interesting + Japan is the home to some of the greatest technological innovations of our time so it is a dream of mine to work there one day.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ML Projects, YOUTUBE VIDEOS, general help on programming, game development or anything computer related. (if i dont know about it, i would be glad to learn it with you 🙂)
- 📫 How to reach me: you can reach me on Discord at kabeer2004 or on LinkedIn [www.linkedin.com/in/kabeer-ahmed-merchant]
