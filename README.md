- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kabeer2004 (Certified Nerd)
- 👀 I’m interested in ANYTHING Python related (or even anything computer related lmao).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I would consider myself a beginner - intermediate level Python programmer. My other skills include Unreal Engine, Kali Linux (along with experience with various cybersec tools) and video editing.
- 💀 My hobbies include music production and playing Valorant along with a recently growing obsession with gymming and the martial art Yongmoodo.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Hacking Projects, YOUTUBE VIDEOS, general help on programming, game development or anything computer related. (if i dont know about it, i would be glad to learn it with you 🙂)
- 📫 How to reach me: you can reach me on Discord at <kabeer#7231> (without the <>)
