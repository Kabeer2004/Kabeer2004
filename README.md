- 💀 My hobbies include music production and playing Valorant along with a recently growing obsession with gymming and the martial art Yongmoodo.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Hacking Projects, YOUTUBE VIDEOS, general help on programming, game development or anything computer related. (if i dont know about it, i would be glad to learn it with you 🙂)
